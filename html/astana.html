            can see the view of Astana</a></p>
    <br>

    <p id="paragraph1">Akmola settlement was founded in 1830, possibly named after a local landmark‚Äî–ê“õ –º–æ–ª–∞ literally
        means white grave in Kazakh‚Äîalthough this theory is not universally accepted. In 1832, it was granted town
        status and renamed Akmolinsk. In 1961 under Khrushchev's government, it was renamed Tselinograd, Russian for
        "virgin lands city". In 1991 following Kazakhstan's independence, the name was changed to Akmola.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p id="paragraph2">In December 1997, the city replaced Almaty as the capital of Kazakhstan, and in May 1998, it was
        renamed Astana, which means "capital city" in Kazakh. In March 2019, the capital was renamed to Nur-Sultan
        (/Àån ä…ôrs älÀàt…ëÀên/; Kazakh pronunciation: [n ä…æ s ält…ën]; Kazakh: –ù“±—Ä-–°“±–ª—Ç–∞–Ω, romanized: N≈´r-S≈´ltan) in honor of the
        long-ruling President Nursultan Nazarbayev, shortly after his resignation. In September 2022, President
        Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a constitutional amendment to revert to the name Astana. As of 2022, it holds the
        Guinness World Record for the capital city with the most name changes in modern times</p>

    <br>
    <p id="paragraph3">Astana is located on the steppe plain and is divided into two parts by the Esil River ‚Äì the right
        and left banks. The right bank is considered historical and has some early 20th-century architectural monuments,
        parks, squares, and Soviet-era residential areas. On the other hand, the left bank is associated with the modern
        history of the city, and it is where many entertainment venues, administrative offices, and new residential
        neighborhoods are located.<br> <br>

        Astana is divided into five administrative districts: Saryarka, Baikonur, Almaty (on the right bank), and Esil
        and Nura districts (on the left bank). The city has a classic chess building system with parallel and
        perpendicular streets, which makes it easy for tourists to navigate. Most public transport stops are equipped
        with city maps, and there are street signs at intersections to help visitors find their way around.</p>
